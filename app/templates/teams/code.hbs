    <h1>Moin!</h1>

    <p>
      I’m the <a href="http://hood.ie/animals/#dev-beaver">Dev Beaver</a> and am
      happy to welcome you on Hoodie’s Code Team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our main objective is to make Hoodie’s code as easy to contributo to as
      possible. If there is something that doesn’t make sense, it’s on us, please
      let us know and we will try to clarify it for you and document it for
      everyone else for the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Code Team lead is <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/">Gregor</a>. He
      keeps the overview of everything code and helps everyone interested to
      contribute to or help maintain Hoodie’s codebase. Say hi <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m">on twitter</a>
      or <a href="http://hood.ie/chat">on our Hoodie Chat</a>.

    <h2>What is Hoodie?</h2>

    <p>
      Hoodie, at its core, is a server that comes with its own database and a
      client API. It basically allows you to build web applications with just
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and use the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client#api">Hoodie Client AP</a>
      for user authentication and data persistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to understand how things work internally, a good place to start
      is the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/tree/master/server">Hoodie Server README</a>.
      But don’t get intimidated by all of Hoodie’s code. We worked hard to split
      up the code base into smaller modules, and if you want to start to contribute,
      you can start contributing to each of this small modules, without the need
      to understand all of Hoodie. Each module has their own documentation, tests
      and instructions on how to get going.
    </p>
