    <h2>We are looking for a Design Team Lead</h2>

    <p>
      The design team has currently no team lead. A team lead is looking after
      what we want to achieve as community and translates it into design-related
      task. They try to grow a team of contributors and maintainers that help
      to work on these issues and help others to become part of the team.
    </p>

      <a href="https://twitter.com/hoodiehq">on twitter</a> or <a href="http://hood.ie/chat/">on slack</a> :)
