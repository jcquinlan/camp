    <h1>Salut!</h1>

    <p>
      I‚Äôm the <a href="http://hood.ie/animals/#blog-bear">Blog Bear</a>!
      We have lots of good stories here at Hoodie, I love to share them!
      You might wonder what writers like me can contribute to an Open Source
      project, so please let me introduce us first!
    </p>

    <h2>
      What is Hoodie?
    </h2>

    <p>
      <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a> is a global, <strong>inclusive
        community</strong> built around supporting the <strong>open source</strong>
        software development effort of enabling (and empowering) folks to be
        able to build applications for the web. It accomplishes this by serving
        as a complete backend for your apps; it works immediately
        ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù:
        <strong>develop your frontend code, plug it into Hoodie‚Äôs
        frontend-friendly API and your app is ready.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hoodie can refer to both the software development project, and the broader
      community. For more information about both, visit
      <a href="http://hood.ie/">hood.ie</a>. üê∂
    </p>

    <h2>What is open source?</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open source software</a>
      (commonly abbreviated as OSS) is computer software with its source code made
      available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights
      to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
      Open source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner, for
      example, by <strong>hosting code on GitHub</strong> and <strong>collaborative
      discussion on <a href="http://hood.ie/chat/">Slack and IRC</a></strong>.
    </p>

      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      We are an inclusive community first
    </h2>

    <p>
      Hoodie is an open source project and community <strong>‚Äúbeyond software.‚Äù</strong>
      Our team strongly believes that open source, an integral component of modern
      technology, is changing the way people collaborate and create, and that
      extends far beyond the source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hoodie is built by an amazing and dedicated community consisting of developers
      and non-coding experts. It relies on strong values like diversity, empowerment
      and decentralisation. At its core Hoodie exists to empower people and make web
      development easier and more accessible to a wide range of people.
    </p>

    <p>
      We require all participation within the Hoodie project and community to act
      according to a <a href="http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
      We ask you to follow these guidelines which help steer
      <strong>our interactions</strong> and strive to keep Hoodie a positive,
      growing project and community and help us <strong>provide and ensure a safe
      environment for everyone</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What does the editorial team do?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Editorial Team is one of many talented teams that contributes to
      Hoodie‚Äôs success. <strong>Our primary focus is Hoodies‚Äô communication with
      the wider community.</strong> We want to keep community members up to date
      with what we are doing but also showcase it to everyone who has used/is
      using/wants to use Hoodie for their project. We want to make Hoodie as open
      as possible with their process and act as a source of inspiration to the
      larger Open Source community.

    <p>
      <strong>If you are brand new to Hoodie</strong>
      check out our <a href="http://hood.ie/contribute/">contribution guide</a>.
      We‚Äôre looking for people of all sorts, so don‚Äôt be afraid to get involved.
      If you‚Äôre passionate about contributing to a great community, we want you! üíé
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If you are brand new to open source (including GitHub)</strong>
      first, welcome! üéâ If you haven‚Äôt checked it out yet,
      <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">opensource.com</a>
      has some very helpful introductory resources that will give you a good
      understanding of the premise of open source and its ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be a Hoodie contributor, you will need a GitHub account (which is free
      for open source), <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up here</a>. To
      get familar with GitHub as an online tool, they have created several
      tutorials which you can find via
      <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will also need to know
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
      a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. GitHub provides a
      <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown tutorial</a>,
      and Daring Fireball has a particular thorough resource on
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        Please be assured you will not have to have any prior knowledge of
        code or development to be a Hoodie contributor, especially within the
        Editorial team.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>How to use GitHub</h2>

    <p>
      The way in which the Editorial team uses GitHub is a bit different
      from other areas on the Hoodie team.
    </p>

    <p>
      This repository (or collection) serves as the source of truth for the
      Editorial team. We use the repository in two ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Documentation</strong>
        of processes and resources (such as our style guide, or templates for
        types of reoccuring writing contributions)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Idea capturing</strong>
        of all editorial contributions through the
        <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues">Issues section</a>
        of this repository
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not publish anything live to the externally facing websites from this
      repository. This is a <strong>safe place to learn, ask questions, and make
        mistakes.</strong> So breathe easy. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    </p>

    <h2>Becoming a Hoodie contributor</h2>

    <p>
      If you enjoyed contributing a first time to Hoodie, we‚Äôd love to have you onboard. üê∂
      See the
      <a href="http://hood.ie/contribute/">
        Contribution Guide for the
        overall project at hood.ie/contribute
      </a>.
      Another great way to determine if you‚Äôd like to continue on the project is
      to see the
      <a href="http://hood.ie/about/">Hoodie project goals</a> and also review
      the <a href="http://hood.ie/initiatives/">project initiatives</a>, which
      are areas of the project supported across the entire team.
    </p>

    <h3>So you want to be a contributor</h3>

    <p>
      Once you have made a contribution via GitHub (completing an issue, mergine
      a PR (pull request), etc.) we would like to invite you to be a collaborator
      on the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq">Hoodie GitHub repository</a>.
      Please note, this is not an automated process, and requires one of the core
      maintainers to invite you ‚Äì so if you are reading this and have
      <strong>not yet been invited</strong>,
      please get ahold of one of the folks mentioned below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Becoming a collaborator simply means that you gain <strong>push</strong>
      access to projects across the repository. We ask that until you have become
      a regular collaborator, that you still follow a common review process
      typically referred to as using <strong>pull requests</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>review process</strong> is begun by submitting a
      <strong>pull request</strong> back to the original version (branch) of a
      repository. Many, many, many amazing tutorials have been created about the
      pull request process so I won‚Äôt recap that here, but instead point you to
      the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">GitHub tutorial</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Hoodie, pull requests need to be approved by
      <strong>two other contributors</strong>,
      before being merged into the project.
    </p>

    <h3>Next steps</h3>

    <p>
      You‚Äôve have made your first contribution to the Hoodie project! üéâ
    </p>

    <p>
      You‚Äôve been added as a collaborator! üòé
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, what‚Äôs next?
    </p>

    <p>
      This grey area of onboarding is one our team is looking to improve across
      the project so first ‚Äì
      <strong>please give as much feedback about this as possible</strong>
      (you can <a href="mailto:renrutnnej@gmail.com?Subject=I%20have%20onboarding%20feedback!">email Jenn right here</a>)
      but know that it‚Äôs an area we want to make better.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Next+steps%22">Next steps</a>
      label in the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues">Issues section</a>
      for editorial contributions considered to be a little more involved than
      what we‚Äôd ask first time contributors to take on. Check those out to see
      if anything resonates.
    </p>

    <h3>
      If not, please feel free, empowered, and highly valued to
      <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/new">make suggestions</a>
      for contributions you‚Äôd like to see on the project. Your brand new and
      completely unique perspective is incredibly important to shaping this project.
